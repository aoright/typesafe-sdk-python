# TypeSafe AI Python SDK

Python SDK for [TypeSafe AI](https://typesafe.ai).

## Quickstart

Install the SDK:

```
uv add typesafe-sdk
```

Add the `http2` extra (`typesafe-sdk[http2]`) to enable [HTTP/2 support](https://docs.typesafe.ai/sdk/python/usage/#http2).

Set `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` in your environment, then instantiate and use the client:

```python
from typesafe_sdk import Choice, TypeSafeClient

with TypeSafeClient() as client:
    response = client.system_one(
        state={"document": "I was charged twice. Please fix this ASAP."},
        questions={
            "category": Choice(
                instructions="What is this ticket about?",
                criteria={"billing": None, "technical": None, "other": None},
            ),
        },
    )

print(response.choices["category"].choice)
```
